## Fonts 

Install a [patched font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).

To do this on a linux distribution, follow these steps.

1. Download a [Nerd Font](http://nerdfonts.com/)
2. Unzip and copy to `~/.fonts`
3. Run the command `fc-cache -fv` to manually rebuild the font cache

On Mac, you can should be able to simply "double click" on the `*.ttf` files instead of running `fc-cache -fv` command.
